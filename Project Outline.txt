RISC-V CPU Design and Simulation Project 

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Single-cycle RISC-V CPU simulation in Python
- Focus on RV32I base instruction set with core operations

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:

Phase 1: Foundation Components - AVAILABLE (midterm utilities)
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) - Available in utils/alu.py, utils/mdu.py
- Register File operations - Available in utils/bitvec.py, utils/twos_complement.py  
- Memory Interface utilities - Available in utils/ (bit-vector operations)

Phase 2+3: Instruction Decoder & Control Unit - COMPLETED
- Instruction decoder supporting essential formats (R,I,S,B,U,J)
- Control signal generation for single-cycle CPU
- Test with prog.hex (20 instructions)

Phase 4: Single-Cycle Datapath - 🚧 TO BE IMPLEMENTED (separate branch)
- Connect all components (ALU, Register File, Memory, Control)
- Implement fetch-decode-execute cycle
- Complete CPU integration with utils/ utilities

Files:
- core/instruction_decoder.py - Working
- core/control_unit.py - Working
- utils/ - Complete RISC-V utilities from midterm project
- test_prog_hex.py - Test framework ready
- prog.hex - Test program ready

Test Status:
- Instruction decoder - All formats working
- Control unit - Signal generation working  
- Integration - decode_and_control() working
- Utils available - All arithmetic/memory utilities ready
- Phase 4 - Ready for implementation in separate branch
