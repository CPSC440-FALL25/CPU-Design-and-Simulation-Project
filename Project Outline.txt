RISC-V CPU Design and Simulation Project 

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Single-cycle RISC-V CPU simulation in Python
- Focus on RV32I base instruction set with core operations

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:

Phase 1: Foundation Components - AVAILABLE (midterm utilities)
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) - Available in utils/alu.py, utils/mdu.py
- Register File operations - Available in utils/bitvec.py, utils/twos_complement.py  
- Memory Interface utilities - Available in utils/ (bit-vector operations)

Phase 2+3: Instruction Decoder & Control Unit - COMPLETED
- Instruction decoder supporting essential formats (R,I,S,B,U,J)
- Control signal generation for single-cycle CPU
- Test with prog.hex (20 instructions)

Phase 4: Single-Cycle Datapath - COMPLETED (feature/single-cycle-cpu branch)
- Connect all components (ALU, Register File, Memory, Control) 
- Implement fetch-decode-execute cycle 
- Complete CPU integration with utils/ utilities 

Files:
- core/instruction_decoder.py - Working
- core/control_unit.py - Working
- core/register_file.py - Complete register file
- core/memory_interface.py - Instruction/data memory
- core/integrated_alu.py - Unified ALU interface
- core/single_cycle_datapath.py - Complete CPU implementation
- utils/ - Complete RISC-V utilities from midterm project
- test_prog_hex.py - Test framework ready
- test_datapath.py - Comprehensive CPU tests
- prog.hex - Test program ready and working

Test Status:
- Instruction decoder - All formats working
- Control unit - Signal generation working  
- Integration - decode_and_control() working
- Utils available - All arithmetic/memory utilities ready
- Phase 4 - COMPLETED - Full single-cycle CPU implemented and tested
- Complete CPU - Successfully executing prog.hex with all instruction types
