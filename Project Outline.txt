RISC-V CPU Design and Simulation Project 

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Single-cycle RISC-V CPU simulation in Python
- Focus on RV32I base instruction set with core operations

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:

Phase 1: Foundation Components (Separate)
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Register File (32 registers)
- Memory Interface

Phase 2+3: Instruction Decoder & Control Unit (COMPLETED)
- Minimal instruction decoder supporting essential formats (R,I,S,B,U,J)
- Basic control signal generation
- Essential operations: ADD, ADDI, SUB, LUI, LW, SW, BEQ, JAL
- Test with prog.hex (20 instructions)

Phase 4: Single-Cycle Datapath (Next)
- Connect all components
- Implement fetch-decode-execute cycle
- Basic pipeline without hazards

Files:
- core/instruction_decoder.py
- core/control_unit.py
- test_prog_hex.py
- prog.hex

Test Status:
- Instruction decoder - All formats working
- Control unit - Essential signals generated
- Integration - decode_and_control() working
- Awaiting Phase 1 components for full CPU test
